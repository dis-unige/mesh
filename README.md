# Notebooks for the anlysis of [NLM Medical Subject Headings MeSH](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html)

## Extracting information from MeSH thesaurus

The processus of extracting information frome MeSH follows this simple steps:

 1. Download MeSH thesaurus in XML format from https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/filelist.html
 1. Extract and anlyze the MeSH XML tree
 1. Select the informations to extract with the UID (loops and secondary loops)
 
## Exemples

1. pharamacological_actions

The idea, proposed by Mrs Kirsten van Gelderen-Ziesemer for the workshop "[Mining PubMed metadata with Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks](https://www.conftool.com/eahil2019/index.php?page=browseSessions&downloads=show&form_session=39&mode=table&presentations=show)", was to obtain all the possible entry terms for one particular pharmacological action without manual copy/paste form the multiple MeSH terms concerned. The solution proposed in this notebook was to execute two separate extractions for each MeSH term: one with the phramacological actions and another with the entry terms. Then we merge the two dataframes and get a table with all the possible entry terms for each pharmacological action. There are 48000 variants in total and for one single term as "antihypertensive agents" ther are 1188 entry terms.

In this folder You will find the jupyter notebook (mesh_extraction_pharamacological_actions.ipynb) with the code and the desctription of the process. It contains also the files generated by the code as the complete table of terms and the list of 1188 entry terms using the exemple of "antihypertensive agents".
