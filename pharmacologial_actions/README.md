## Extracting information from MeSH thesaurus: Pharamacological actions

The idea, proposed by Mrs Kirsten van Gelderen-Ziesemer for the workshop "[Mining PubMed metadata with Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks](https://www.conftool.com/eahil2019/index.php?page=browseSessions&downloads=show&form_session=39&mode=table&presentations=show)", was to collect all underlying [entry terms (synonyms)](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/intro_entry.html) for the MeSH terms that are noted for one particular pharmacological action, without manual copy/paste form the multiple MeSH terms concerned. The list of synonyms may be useful in the research work carried out in systematic reviews, in order to include the largest possible number of studies.

The solution proposed in this folder was to execute two separate extractions for each MeSH term: one with all the Phramacological Actions and another one with all the Entry Terms for each MeSH term. Then we merge the two dataframes and get a table with all the possible Entry Terms for all the MeSH terms concerned by each Pharmacological Action. There are 4'617 Pharmacological Actions, 234'843 combination of MeSH Term / Entry Term and 48'181 combinations of Pharmacological Actions / Entry Term in total. For example, one single Pharmacological Action as "Antihypertensive agents" has 102 MeSH terms and 1'188 Entry Terms for those MeSH terms.

In this folder You will find 2 jupyter notebooks with the code and the desctription of the process:

* **[1_mesh_extraction_pharamacological_actions_and_entry_terms.ipynb](1_mesh_extraction_pharamacological_actions_and_entry_terms.ipynb)**: notebook used for the analyze the MeSH tree and execute two separate extractions: one with all the Phramacological Actions and another one with all the Entry Terms for each MeSH term
* **[2_mesh_entry_terms_for_a_pharamacological_action.ipynb](2_mesh_entry_terms_for_a_pharamacological_action.ipynb)**: notebook used to import the files generated by the first notebook and merge the two tables in a single dataframe with all the possible Entry Terms for all the MeSH terms concerned by each Pharmacological Action. One pharmacological action can be defined at the beginning as an example and allows to obtain all the Entry Terms of the MeSH terms concerned by this particular pharmacological action.

This folder contains also the files generated by the code:

* **[mesh2018_pharmacological_actions.tsv](mesh2018_pharmacological_actions.tsv)**: The table of 4'617 Pharmacological Actions with the MeSH terms associated
* **[mesh2018_entry_terms.tsv](mesh2018_entry_terms.tsv)**: The table of 234'843 combination of MeSH Term / Entry Term
* **[mesh2018_pharmacological_actions_entry_terms.tsv](mesh2018_pharmacological_actions_entry_terms.tsv)**: The table of 48'181 combinations of Pharmacological Actions / Entry Terms
* **[mesh2018_Antihypertensive_Agents.tsv](mesh2018_Antihypertensive_Agents.tsv)**: the table of 1'188 Entry Terms and MeSH terms assocaited with the "Antihypertensive agents" Pharmacological Action
* **[mesh2018_Antihypertensive_Agents_entry_terms.txt](mesh2018_Antihypertensive_Agents_entry_terms.txt)**: the flat list of 1'188 Entry Terms of MeSH terms assocaited with the "Antihypertensive agents" Pharmacological Action

You can modify the pharmacologial action and obtain new results launching the second notebook with Binder using the link or the button below. The files generated by the notebooks on Binder are available from the dashboard by clicking on the jupyter icon at the top left of the notebook :
